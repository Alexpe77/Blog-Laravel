#Blog Laravel

Welcome to my first ever project in Laravel !
It's a blog project where you can navigate between the different articles or search a specific one.
I also create a dashboard so you can create an account, log yourself in.
In the future you will be able to create a new article, modify it or delete it if you want.
As you can see it's the beginning of the project so there will be a lot of different things added from day to day.
Stay connected to see the progress of this project :smile:
I use bootstrap to style this project which is also new for me
